Open Source Software (OSS) has been a huge driver in innovation in software. There's no doubt the world would look radically different if it wasn't for the free copying, editing and distribution of open source software. What OSS has thought us, it's that it increases the speed of innovation _and_ the quality of innovation. It helps both the person or entity that made it and everybody that can use it freely. It's a positiv sum game with exponential benefit. How can we take the learnings from Open Source to other areas?

What can we learn from the open source movement? TLDR:
- Sharing massively increases the speed of innovation
- Sharing massively increases the quality of innovation
- Sharing makes everything positive sum - you gain more than you give
- You build a community of fans - attracting both customers and employees


Te platforms that enable sharing thrives. Before GitHub hackers always found a way to share shoftware. With Github...
Github let's you add to other pepoles code. Or the other way around - you can get other people to work on your project for free. 
Not only that, github let's you see the conversations going on: how they think about issues, new features, how they set them up. You can view the entire history of the project - what it looked like when it was new 15 years ago up until today.

Dribble and Behance makes designers share and collaborate. Figma has taken this even a step furter. 

Notion and Coda is letting people share their templates - you can now see how people are setting up their project management flow, CRM system, Company Handbooks...

Airtable has become an open database - create whatever you want. And you create stuff to build on top of...

Roam research lets users code away on their own inside the app, and are massively transforming and evolving the plattform way faster than they are able to on their own.

Cryptocurrency is all open source. It has to be, else no one would be able to run a node. THis means the speed innovation in the space is incredably high. As soon as someone releases something new, different or meaningful, it will quickly get copied and expanded upon and benefit the entire ecosystem.

Wikipedia is the oldtimer where an open plattform gets better and better, by just letting anybody write on it.

For the companies that share all their stuff, it seems net positive. For those who are afraid of the competition are missing the point. The ones copying you will never be as good as you. And for those that share, they get so much back. Both in actual product- and business developent, but also in brand recognition, credibilty. Attracting talented people. Getting new business opportunitites. 


By opening up, the platforms are evolving quickly, 

It's not a matter of a transaction where I give you one and you give me one. This stuff is happening in a network. By you giving one, you may acutally be giving millions (one to everybody) and you will likely receive many back. This is a positive sum game - give one receive many. We'll get the famous exponential graph.

Bare with me as we explore what this would look like
Gumroad is already sharing their 
Basecamp is sharing their process - and have written three books about it.
