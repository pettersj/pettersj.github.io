Nassim Taleb coined the term Antifragile. Antifragile means to gain from disorder, volatility, randomness, stressors, adventure, risk, and uncertainty. It's not the same as robust, which merely can withstand disorder.

Nassim Taleb uses this concept in an interesting way of investing: being happy to lose a little bit of money over an extended period of time, with the goal of winning big should the bet pay of.


The important thing about tinkering, trial and error, is that each iteration is limtied in downside. The bets have to be small enough so you don't go personally bankrupt, burn out or lose your home.
