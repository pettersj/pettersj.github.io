The word productivity awakens the feeling of "a lot". That a lot should happen all the time.

And it's often that way it's used. Which is why everybody is "busy" all the time. Of course  Everybody wants to be productive. You'll get a strange look of you are not busy. Because not being busy means you're not being productive.

I think we can compare this to the caveman dragging a cart on square wheels, with no time time to try out the new round wheels anther guy just made. And we know this. Obviously there are more productive was of being productive than just doing a lot all the time.

I think we can become more productive by _not being productive_. We can be **antiproductive**. 

Withdraw to let you mind wander, to reflect, to think about completely new ideas. That instead of doing a lot, you make space to do nothing. Leave room to think about the smarter ways. The ways that makes all the other stuff you were supposed to do, no longer is necessary to do. The ways that suddenly unstuck your stuck project.

When was the last time you blocked out time in your calendar to just sit? For yourself, not a "brainstorming session" with your team.

Without room you'll never have time to explore new solutions. Totally new ideas. Totally new ways of looking at the situaton.

We need room to let our minds wander. A crammed brain working heads down works with blinders on. Everybody who's ever had a good idea knows this. Your best idea never shows up when you are cramming. It shows up when we have stopped thinking or doing: when we are in the shower, the bed or out for a run.

For those of us who are always all-in it's easy to think that we have to worker harder and longer. Chase all the time. But all-in means you actually have to make room for nothing. Without time and space you'll never think clearly. You'll do the same stuff twice, spin in circle, do stuff you hadn't had to do, and stuff that even hurts the thing you were trying to do in the first place.

You can't work all the time. You don't have time for it.
