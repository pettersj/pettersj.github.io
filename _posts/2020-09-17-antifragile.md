Antifragile means to gaining from disorder. Disorder meaning volatility, randomness, disorder, stressors, adventure, risk, and uncertainty. It's not the same as robust, which merely can withstand disorder. Antifragile things get better from it!

Nassim Taleb uses this concept in an interesting way of investing: being happy to lose a little bit of money over an extended period of time, with the goal of winning big should the bet pay of.

This strikes a resembelence to other industries as well: 
- the vc funding many startups knowing that most will fail and only very few will make it big
- the entrepreneur trying failing at many businesses before creating one that succeeds
- the artists testing new designs, then suddenly gets a lucky break and is forever after a genius

But it strikes everything else wrong:
- The employee who gets the same paycheck whether the business is doing great, perfectly ok or just plain out shitty. 
- The index-fund investor who gains a little bit everyday, but can be completely wiped out in a market crash. 

One caveat, of course, is that the volatility is not so great that it kills you. Don't go personally bankrupt, burn out, lose your home, or don't actually die.
