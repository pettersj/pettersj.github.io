A rigid system is a system that solves one problem in one way. 

It may be a good way to start building a system: You find a problem and make a solutions for those who struggle this particular problem.

But over time this may become a problem. Because since the user of the system will always evolve, you must decide whether to develop the system to the user's new needs, or stay on the same solution. As a user of the system you will then have a problem. You'll either grow out of the system, or the system will outgrow you.

A system that once solved a problem for you, has now become a problem for you.


#### The difference between malleable and rigid systems

There is a difference in systems where the developer changes the system over time and a system where you as a user can change it to your needs. 

Developers of rigid systems tend to mix up malleable for the user and malleable for themselves. Because they can always change the system. The problem is that when the developers change the system, they change it for __everybody__. As a user you have no choice. The system changes wether you want it to or not.

This is the difference between rigid and malleable systems. The rigid systems are changed by the developer. The malleable are changed by you.


#### What's a good malleable system?

If we look at the open platforms like Shopify, Wordpress and a little under the radar Trello, we'll see that they let their users add functions to their system by adding plugins, using open APIs and letting their users code on top of their platform. 

All good systems solve an underlying problem. Shopify let's you sell stuff on the internet. Wordpress let's you get seen on the internet. Trello helps you keep track on what to do. But they don't have just one way of solving the problem. There is an infinte amount of ways you could sell something online, infinite variations of functions needed on a website, and there is enormous variations of how companies work. The best systems let their users shape the system to their needs, by adding or removing functions, and creating their own workflows. So Shopify for me is not Shopify for you.

#### Good Systems

Good systems let the users take charge of making the changes themselves. Good systems makes in intuitive, easy and without problems to make the changes they want. Good systems make it easy to revert those changes if they so choose. 

If you want to make a system that stays relevant for your users year after year, it's probably impossible to do it by developing everything yourself. It's beter to develop the possibility for users to develop the system with you, to make their own changes to fit their use case.

Make malleable systems, not rigid systems.
