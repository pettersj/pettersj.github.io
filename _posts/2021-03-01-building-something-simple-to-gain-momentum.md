There is a thing all creators face. Seth Godin calls "the resistance". Paul Graham calls it "the fear of making something lame". It's the fear that stops you even before you even start.

To overcome this resisitance Paul Graham suggest treating your work as a hack or a sketch. Treating it lightly will make you evaluate the work less harshly. Patrick Collison says about shipping something unfinished: "I'm just trying to see how far such a naive approach can get."

Follow in the footsteps of those who have built great stuff. Start building something simple. 

Why simple? Because we all get so locked up in our minds of what a full featured product would look like. And the work to get there is endless, so we freeze up. We stop. 

So get a first rough first draft out the door. Ship it so you can learn from your experiment. Get used to shipping so you gain momentum. 

Momentum is the snowball that grows and go faster the more it rolls. With momentum, suddenly, you'll have something that sticks.
