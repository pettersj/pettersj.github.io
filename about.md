### Petter Sjulstad
I am an entrepreneur, tinkerer and thinker. 
Previously founded Arctic Coffee. Now a self-thought programmer working on new ideas. I explore problems, solutions and better ways of doing things.

This is where I write:

- Things I have learned that I think others will benefit from
- Things I find interesting
- Useful tools for anyone that wants to build anything
